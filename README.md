In this repository are listed the plugins I created for Gephi. See the [Gephi Marketplace](https://marketplace.gephi.org/) for the ready-to-use versions of these plugins.

## 1. Alphabetical Sorter (2012)
This plugin is helpful to neatly sort and put apart isolated nodes floating around, before an export to SVG or PNG.  
See the [Gephi Marketplace](https://marketplace.gephi.org/plugin/alphabetical-sorter/) for details.  


## 2. Force Atlas 3D (2013)

Force Atlas 2 is a layout for Gephi created by Mathieu Jacomy et al., scalable to 10,000 nodes and more.  
Force Atlas *3D* extends it to 3 dimensions instead of 2.  
See the [Gephi Marketplace](https://marketplace.gephi.org/plugin/force-atlas-3d/) for details.  

## 3. Maps of Countries (2013)

Take a country, continent or the entire world map and display it with Gephi. Useful to serve as a background for geolocalized networks.
Latest version: 1.4.1 (2015). Includes Australian states and allows for the control of the thickness of the lines.
See the [Gephi Marketplace](https://marketplace.gephi.org/plugin/maps-of-countries/) for details.  


## 4. Excel / csv converter to network (2013)

Import an Excel spreadsheet or csv file into Gephi, and creates networks based on co-occurrences in each line of the file. Can also create dynamic networks since version 1.4.

## 5. Give color to your nodes (2013)

Reads a node attribute that contains RGB or #hex values, and colors nodes accordingly.

## 6. Scientometrics Overlay Toolkit (2013)

Overlays bibliographical references onto a map of science, a la [Loet Leydesdorf et al](http://www.leydesdorff.net/overlaytoolkit/).  
This plugin works but is not finalized. Not available on the Gephi Marketplace, but please do contact me if you'd need to use it.

Creates a network based on the similarity between entities. Reads a csv file containing a list of entities with their features, and creates a network that is directly imported into Gephi.
